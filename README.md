# Event-based Datasets

Processing of event-based datasets with optimized data transforms.

## Overview

This repository provides tools for processing event-based datasets. These datasets are sourced from various original repositories and are made available through Hugging Face for easier access and faster processing.

## About

These are not my original datasets. I discovered [Tonic's](https://github.com/neuromorphs/tonic) Datasets and transform modules, which provided excellent tools for working with event-based data. Building on this foundation, I:

- Downloaded the original datasets from their source repositories
- Uploaded them to Hugging Face for easier access and distribution
- Created fast data transforms for efficient processing

## Features

- Fast data transforms optimized for event-based data
- Integration with Tonic's dataset and transform modules
- Datasets hosted on Hugging Face for easy access
- Efficient processing pipelines

## References

This section contains references to the original datasets used in this project. These datasets are the work of their respective authors and institutions.
