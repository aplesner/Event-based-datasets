# Event-based Datasets

Processing of event-based datasets with fast data transforms.

## Overview

This repository provides tools for processing event-based datasets. These datasets are sourced from various original repositories and are made available through Hugging Face for easier access and faster processing.

## About

These are not my original datasets, but all found in [Tonic's](https://github.com/neuromorphs/tonic) Datasets module. However, Tonic could be slow and multiple of the datasets had dead links. I:

- Downloaded the original datasets from their source repositories
- Did some light processing as needed and uploaded them to Hugging Face for easier access and distribution
- Created fast data transforms for efficient processing

## References

This section contains references to the original datasets used in this project. These datasets are the work of their respective authors and institutions.
